## 7. Conclusion
Remember, there's rarely a single "correct" answer in system design interviews. The goal is to demonstrate your thought process, problem-solving skills, and ability to design scalable, reliable systems. Practice regularly, stay updated with industry trends, and approach each interview as a collaborative discussion rather than a test.
